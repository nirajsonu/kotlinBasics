Kotlin programs
-------------------
semicolon is optional in kotlin.

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    //println for print value to console with new line
    println("Kotlin is easy for java developers")
    //For print with same line
    print("only syntax is different concepts are same with java")
}

var keyword is introduced in kotlin for assigning any value to variable type is automatically detect by kotlin language.We reassign value which keyword declared in var
val do the same thing except we cannot reassign the value if we do get compile time exception(Val cannot be reassigned).

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var year=2010
    var version=1.0
    var langauge_made_by="jetbrain"
    println("this language is made by "+langauge_made_by+"in "+year +"and the first version is "+version)
}
